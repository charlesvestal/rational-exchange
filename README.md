Giving context to currency exchange

When traveling abroad, sometimes a straight currency exchange doesn't tell the whole story. Your home's tipping and tax-adding customs may differ from where you currently are, and the price tag you see may "feel like" something entirely different.

An example:

In Norway, a beer might cost NOK 96. That price, however, includes any tax, and tipping is not expected in Norway as it is in some other places. As a straight exchange conversion, that could work out to USD $16.00.

In Texas, however, a price on a menu usually has an 8.25% sales tax added to the total, and it is customary to tip 20%. So in reality, that $16.00 beer should "feel like" roughly $12.50, with a dollar in tax and a $2.50 tip.

By cataloging these customs in various locales, I hope to bring some additional context to currency exchange, and make it all a little bit more rational.
